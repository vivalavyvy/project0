In this class, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of computer systems. Specifically, I am interesetd in writing programs that use system call libraries for process and thread creation and manipulation, signal handling, and network communication in C. My experiences setting up the Git repository and Vagrant has been straightforward. However, it was delayed because of my network speed. It took my computer 3 hours to install files from vagrant up command. My computer seems to overheat as well. I am using my mom's computer,named "Nga Pham." Please help me note this. Thank you very much.
